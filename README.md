## Descripton

- This project is about creating a web page from scratch using what I learn during last lessons.  This page is my personal portfolio where I will be presenting information about myself, projects done, and my contact informations.  


### Acceptance Criterials
- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Work done to complete the challenge
- Creating web site and using CSS to styling the web site.
- I used the id attribute to link nav to the correspoding session in the page.
- To make the first application larger, I used CSS to created a box with width, height and border and use a picture of the application as background.
- To add external link to the first presented application, I have to add an <a href with an span.
- To be able to view this page in different devices, I have to use media query.
