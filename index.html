        <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            As a System Administrator I have had the opportunity to work, oversee and evaluate
            critical systems, special projects and interact with other IT divisions. Before becoming a
            System Administrator, I have worked for 20 years as client facing technician and
            consultant. This experience has allowed me to be involved in making decisions to
            prevent significant downtime to the end user and to work as diligently as possible to
            identify and correct the issue at hand. My experience has allowed me to be
            knowledgeable on major systems infrastructure such as Vmware Horizon View, VMware
            VCenter virtual infrastructure, Enterprise Storage systems such as Compellent, Pure
            Storage, Microsoft Active Directory and Microsoft Exchange Server.<br> <br>
            Accomplished System Administrator with 20 years of experience managing server infrastructure and data-center operations across multiple
            platforms (Linux, Windows, MAC OS, Unix). Background in administering virtual infrastructure in Enterprise and Academic environments.
            Design and implement and optimize IT infrastructure to consistently achieve high availability and performance. Conceive projects and
            deliver to a successful completion to the interested parties. <br></p>
